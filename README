// Aaron and Alan worked togther for this project.

// The Stepping Stones are run by calling ./ss with an optional argumment [-p portNumber]. 
// The Awget is run by calling ./awget <URL> and an optional arugument [-c chainfile]. If the chainfile arugument is not given, then the program reads a local file called chaingang.txt.
// The chainfile must contain vaild IP addresses and the correct port numbers that the Stepping Stones are running on. 

// The file requested by Awget will be stored locally on the machine running Awget, and the files will be removed from the Stepping Stones.

// Multiple Awget calls can occur on the chain of stepping stones at the same time
